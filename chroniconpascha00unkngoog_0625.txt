Δ machonem of five years in these events, as compa-
red with the consulships to which they are referred.

with the exception ol these omissione, (producing these
consequences,) the list of consuls in tha Chronicle‚ from B.
C. 280. to the, reign of Augustus, corresponds with the list
obtained from the other testimonies3 wilh only such variatione
ss might ariae, sor‘the most part, from a transcribet in ex-
pressing Roman names in Greek characters. ’

From the consulship. of Agsippo andflnllor, the list of
consuls in the Chronicle varies so much sr'om the true list,
that a view of both is necessary to be given. The following

columns exhihit the true list ol consuls and 'the list of the ¹

Alexandrino Chronicle. That list begins, ss we have seen,
live years too high: which produces a metachronism ol five
years in assigning the first year of Augustus ¹).

,1) The Chroniele ascribes to Coesm live years, ond to Augustos 563
compating the reign of Angustus from the death of caesor. Tho
two reigns therefore are-5 -Ι- 56 :61 years· But these 61 years,
being made to begin at the consulship of Hirtius and Peneo B. C.
48, hstead ol crem aad Isauricus B. C. 48, are compared troug7
boat with the wrong consuls. ·
